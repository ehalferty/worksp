The ML555, by default uses the 100MHz PCIE_REFCLK input provided at the PCIe 
connector. At the customers discretion, and ICS874003-02 jitter attenuator
clock module can be added which can provide 100MHz, 125MHz or 250MHz REFCLK
outputs to the Virtex-5 LXT GTP transceiver clock input on GTP X0Y2. The 
Virtex-5 LXT devices meet all PCI Express jitter requirements using the
default 100Mhz REFCLK. The CPLD files are provided "in case" a customer 
desires to use a GTP REFCLK frequency other than the default 100MHz design
provided by Xilinx.


This directory contains three JED files for the ML555 board. The only difference 
in functionality between the files is the output frequency generated by the 
ICS874003-02 PCI Express jitter attentuator. The source code, verilog only, for 
the CPLD is in the "verilog" directory. The ML555 uses either a XC2C32-VQ44 
or XC2C32A-VQ44 CPLD. Reference ML555 schematics, page 6 (ICS874003-02) and 
page 13 (CPLD connectivity) for details.

"ml555_CPLD_100MHz_PCIeCLK.jed" is the default CPLD image programmed on the ML555
board and if the customer installs an ICS874003-02 module on the ML555 board, it 
would select a 100MHz PCIe clock of the ICS874003-02 routed to GTP X0Y2. Since the
ICS874003-02 is NOT INSTALLED BY DEFAULT on the ML555 boards, it really doesn't 
matter which of the three CPLD images are loaded onto the board.


"ml555_CPLD_250MHz_PCIeCLK.jed" selects 250MHz PCIe clock of the ICS874003-02.


"ml555_CPLD_125MHz_PCIeCLK.jed" selects 125MHz PCIe clock of the ICS874003-02.

For PCI Express applications "out of the box" the ML555 is preconfigured to use the
100MHz PCIE_REFCLK input provided by the system board and the Platform Flash is
configured to power up and load a 4 lane PCI Express Endpoint Block memory completer
design. 

If a customer installs an ICS874003-02 device on an ML555 and wants to use a different
REFCLK frequency for PCI Express applications, this requires two things: 

(1) Program the CPLD on the ML555 with the "ML555_CPLD_xxxMHz_PCIECLK.jed" file
(2) Program the FPGA with a PCI Express design image that utilizes a xxxMHz GTP REFCLK
    input. For the ML555 board you can start with the COREGen tool and generate either a
    PCI Express Endpoint Block LogiCORE or a PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus LogiCORE
    design.
