    Number used as Latches:                      4
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        598 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as logic:                      591 out of  28,800    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             564
      Number using O5 output only:              21
      Number using O5 and O6:                    6
    Number used as Memory:                       5 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             5
        Number using O6 output only:             5
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        23 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                23

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   440 out of   7,200    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,031
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           338 out of   1,031   32%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 433 out of   1,031   41%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         260 out of   1,031   25%
    Number of unique control sets:              28

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
