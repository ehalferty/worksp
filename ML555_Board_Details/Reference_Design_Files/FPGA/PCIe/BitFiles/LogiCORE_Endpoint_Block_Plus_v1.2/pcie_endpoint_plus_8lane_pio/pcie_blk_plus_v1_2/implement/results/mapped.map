Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,312 out of   7,200   18%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,116
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           622 out of   3,116   19%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 918 out of   3,116   29%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,576 out of   3,116   50%
    Number of unique control sets:             174

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
