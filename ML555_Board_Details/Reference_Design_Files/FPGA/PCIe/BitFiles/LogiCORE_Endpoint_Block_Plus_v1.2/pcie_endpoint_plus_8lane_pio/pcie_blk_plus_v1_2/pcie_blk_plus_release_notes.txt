INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains release notes for the PCI Express Endpoint Block
Plus LogiCORE (hereafter referred to as "the core"),
including enhancements, resolved issues and outstanding known issues.


To obtain the latest updates and documentation for this core, please visit the
PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus LogiCORE Lounge. The lounge is
accessible from the "Access Lounge" button on the cores product page:

http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=V5_PCI_Express_Block_Plus

For information on how to set up and use the core, please refer to the PCI
Express Endpoint Block Plus Getting Started User Guide.  More comprehensive user
information is available in the PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus User Guide.


RELEASE NOTES for the PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus v1.2
=================================================================

1. System Requirements

   - Platform Support information for this core version is described in the
     release notes AR for ISE 9.1i IP Update 1:
     http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xil_ans_display.jsp?getPagePath=24307

   - Special requirements for this core version:
     ISE 9.1i Service Pack 2

2. Enhancements

   - Improved Timing Closure
   - Addition of trn_rcpl_streaming_n input to support Continuous Request of
     Completion TLPs on the PCIe Express Block receive interface. This enables
     upstream Memory Read transmission without the need for data rate
     limiting. Please refer to the PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus User Guide
     for more information.

3. Bugs Fixed

   - Core trn_reset_n is not a function of sys_reset_n
      o CR 432068

      On hard reset (sys_reset_n) the user application was not reset via
      trn_reset_n. trn_reset_n is now asserted with sys_reset_n.

   - Default reference clock frequency should be 100 MHz
      o CR 431681

      CORE Generator GUI defaulted to 250 MHz reference clock frequency. It
      now defaults to 100 MHz.

   - BAR4 mismatch between core and GUI setting
      o CR 429604

      CORE Generator GUI incorrectly indicated that BAR4 was disabled by
      default. However, the default range was set to FFFF_0000. The default
      is now 0000_0000 (disabled) for the core and the GUI.

   - Timing Closure
      o CR 427414

      8 Lane and 4 Lane cores with interface clock frequency selection of 250
      MHz do not reliably meet timing. Several additional LOC constraints have
      been added to the UCF files.

4. Known Issues

    4.0  General Comments

      - Simulation and Implementation support for ISE 9.1i SP2

    4.1  Functional Issues

      - PCI Ordering Rules compliance
        o CR 431927

        TLPs read from the core's receive interface may not follow PCI
        ordering rules.

        Impact : TLPs may be received out-of-order

        Workaround : None. A future release of the core will address this
        issue.

    4.2  Implementation Issues

      - Timing Closure for LX330T
        o CR 434241

        8 Lane, 4 Lane and 1 Lane cores that use the LX330T UCF file do not meet
        timing when run with the default CORE Generator settings.

        Impact : Designs using using the LX330T UCF file may require the use of
        Multi-Pass Place and Route (MPPR) to meet timing.

        Workaround : Designers should attempt advanced timing closure methods as
        discussed in the Timing Closure section below. A future release of tools
        and/or the core will address this issue.

      - Speed file and design changes

        The design files present in this release are based on timing parameters
        from, and intended for use with, the speed files shipped with ISE 9.1
        SP2. As more device characterization data is collected, Xilinx may
        update the speed files to more closely model device operation.

        Xilinx reserves the right to modify the design files, including The core
        pin-out, in order to maintain full compliance after speed files updates
        occur. To the full extent possible, Xilinx will incorporate such
        modifications without using pin-out changes in an effort to provide
        "transparent" design file updates.


       - Timing Closure

        In order to obtain timing closure, designers may be required to use
        multiple PAR seeds and/or floorplanning. Using Multi-Pass Place and
        Route (MPPR), designers can try multiple cost tables in order to meet
        timing. Please see the Development System Reference Guide in the
        Software Manuals found at: http://www.xilinx.com/support/library.htm for
        more information on using MPPR. Designers may also have to floorplan and
        add advanced placement constraints for both their design and the
        core to meet timing.

        - Xilinx warnings

        The Xilinx tools may issue various warnings, however no errors should
        occur.
